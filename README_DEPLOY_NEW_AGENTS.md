# ðŸš€ Synthcore 2.0 Agent Deployment + Team Validation

This script automates the deployment of all 12 agents and validates cooperative team behavior across three test groups of 4 agents.

### Tools Used:
- `tool_call(agent, tool)` - Tests active invocation
- `tool_create(agent, spec)` - Verifies tool creation intent

## Run Instructions:

```bash
node deploy_new_agents.js
```

This will invoke the deployment pipeline for each agent, validate success, and log results to standard output.

All deployments are production-grade and follow the MCP security and resonance integrity standards.
