# GitHub Repository Creation Guide for Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server

## Introduction

This guide will help you create a GitHub repository for the Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server and push your code to it. The steps are designed to be easy to follow, even if you're not familiar with Git or GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- The Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server code on your computer

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Open your web browser and go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Log in to your GitHub account
3. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page
4. Select "New repository" from the dropdown menu
5. Fill in the repository details:
   - Repository name: `synthcore-2.0-mcp-server`
   - Description: `Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server with 12 agents`
   - Choose "Public" (anyone can see this repository) or "Private" (only you and people you share with can see it)
   - Do NOT check "Add a README file"
   - Do NOT check "Add .gitignore"
   - Do NOT check "Choose a license"
6. Click the "Create repository" button

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with instructions. We'll follow the "push an existing repository from the command line" section.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server directory (you should already be there)
3. Run the following commands (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/synthcore-2.0-mcp-server.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4. If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token)

### Step 3: Verify the Repository

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/synthcore-2.0-mcp-server` in your web browser
2. You should see all your Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server files in the repository
3. Congratulations! Your Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server is now on GitHub

## Troubleshooting

### If you're asked for credentials and regular password doesn't work

GitHub no longer accepts regular passwords for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Synthcore 2.0 MCP Server")
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when prompted

### If you get an error about the repository already existing

If you get an error saying the repository already exists, you may need to force the push:

```bash
git push -f -u origin main
```

Use this with caution as it will overwrite any existing content in the repository.

## Next Steps

Once your repository is created, you can:

- Share the repository URL with others
- Enable GitHub Pages to create a website for your project
- Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Add collaborators to work on the project together
